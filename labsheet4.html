<h2 style="color:white">Ayushmann Khurrana </h2>
<p id="first" style="color:white">Ayushmann Khurrana (born Nishant Khurrana on 14 September 1984) is an Indian actor, singer, and television host. Known for his portrayals of ordinary men often plagued with dysfunction,[2][3] he is the recipient of several awards, including a National Film Award and three Filmfare Awards, and has appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list of 2013 and 2019.

Khurrana won the second season of reality television show MTV Roadies in 2004 and ventured into an anchoring career. He made his film debut in 2012 with the romantic comedy Vicky Donor, in which his performance as a sperm donor earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut.[4][5] Following a brief setback, he starred in the commercially and critically successful romance Dum Laga Ke Haisha (2015). Khurrana went on to establish himself with the comedies Bareilly Ki Barfi (2017), Shubh Mangal Saavdhan (2017), Badhaai Ho (2018), Dream Girl (2019), and Bala (2019); the thriller Andhadhun (2018); and the crime drama Article 15 (2019).[6] Andhadhun ranks among the highest-grossing Indian films of all time; Khurrana's performance as a blind pianist won him the National Film Award for Best Actor and the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor.

In addition to acting, Khurrana has sung for several of his films, including the song "Pani Da Rang", which earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer.

Khurrana was born in Chandigarh. His father P Khurrana is an astrologer and an author on the subject of astrology, whereas his mother Poonam is a housewife and she is of half-Burmese descent[68] and a qualified M.A. in Hindi[citation needed]. While Ayushmann remains busy with his work in Mumbai, his family still stays in Chandigarh. His brother Aparshakti Khurana is a radio jockey at Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM in Delhi and made his debut in the 2016 Aamir Khan-starrer film Dangal.[69][70] The ambiance of literature at home influenced Khurrana as well and he took writing as a hobby. He also maintains a blog where he writes in Hindi and it has been received very well by his admirers.[71] Ayushmann is known for being very close to his family and wife, Tahira Kashyap, who has directed a critically acclaimed film Toffee. They are childhood sweethearts and are parents of a son and a daughter.[72][73] His son, Virajveer, was born on 2 January 2012 and his daughter, Varushka, was born on 21 April 2014.[74][75] In 2018, when he was promoting Badhaai Ho and Andhadhun, his wife Tahira was diagnosed with stage 0 breast cancer. Tahira's positive outlook helped them remain rock solid through this difficult phase.

Two years later, after starring in the poorly received Meri Pyaari Bindu, Khurrana's career progressed with his two other films releases of 2017, Bareilly Ki Barfi and Shubh Mangal Saavdhan, both of which were commercially successful.[6][33] In the former, adapted from Nicolas Barreau's French novel The Ingredients of Love, he played alongside Rajkummar Rao and Kriti Sanon as a writer involved in a love triangle.[38] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV wrote that Khurrana does a "convincing job of mutating from a brooding jilted lover to a crooked manipulator who puts his own interests above everyone else's".[39] In Shubh Mangal Saavdhan, he starred opposite Bhumi Pednekar as a newly engaged man suffering from erectile dysfunction. A remake of the Tamil film Kalyana Samayal Saadham (2013), Khurrana hoped that the film's humorous take on mental and sexual problems faced by men would bring wider attention to the topic.[40] Rajeev Masand took note of how well the film handled sexuality without being crude and commended him for "investing the fellow with genuine likeability and an understated charm".[41] Khurrana received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for the latter film.[42]
